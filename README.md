# C-program-Reminder-Application
I was given a coding test to create a reminder application this is the final result. May help some students or others to learn from it.


This code takes some input with a menu system. Onces you have some messages with time set. Reminders are shown whenever that time occurs. 
I have compiled this in Mac OS and may work with Linux. 
To compile
>>gcc -o out
to run
>>./out
